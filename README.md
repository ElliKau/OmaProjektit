# OmaProjektit
Omia kokeiluja ja ohjelmistoja

This is a collection of my schoolwork currently throughout my studies to be an IT engineering student.
Java folder has some code that was a part of an algorithm course in Joensuu UEF, and it has some background
test programs and interfaces that i wont include here.
Javascript includes a game i had to make for a course.
C# was the first language i learned and it has very basic code, a memorygame!
